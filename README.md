# Network Scanner Tool

## Overview
The **Network Scanner Tool** is a comprehensive Python-based application designed to simplify various network-related tasks. Built with a user-friendly graphical interface (Tkinter), it allows users to perform advanced networking functions, including ARP scanning, packet analysis, custom packet creation, and network performance measurement.

This project leverages the **Scapy** library for packet manipulation and real-time network analysis while ensuring an intuitive and interactive user experience. Whether you're a network engineer, cybersecurity enthusiast, or developer, this tool provides powerful capabilities for analyzing and managing network traffic.

## Features
### 1. **ARP Scan**
- Perform network discovery by scanning for active devices in a given subnet.
- Retrieve IP and MAC addresses of devices on the network.
- Results are displayed in real-time and logged for later review.

### 2. **Packet Analysis**
- Monitor and analyze network packets to and from a specified target IP.
- Filter packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, or All).
- Start and stop the analysis as needed using ON/OFF buttons.
- Display source IP, destination IP, packet length, and protocol in a scrolled text interface.

### 3. **Custom Packet Creation**
- Craft and send ICMP, TCP, or UDP packets to a specified target IP.
- Useful for testing and troubleshooting specific network scenarios.

### 4. **Network Performance Measurement**
- Measure latency (ping time) to a target IP address using ICMP packets.
- Calculate jitter based on variations in response times.
- Log performance metrics for detailed analysis.

### 5. **Real-Time Logging**
- Log all activities (ARP scans, packet analysis, custom packet sends, etc.) to a CSV file for later review.
- Timestamps included for detailed tracking.
